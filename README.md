# CS-F222 @ BITS-Pilani Assignments

## Assignment 1

- [x] **Problem 1**
	- improve complexity(currently O(n^3))
- [x] **Problem 2**
	- topological sorting
	- ~~easier impl? adj matrix~~
	- ~~detect cycle~~
	- ~~failed in b->a<->c | loop in subgraph~~
	- check for more test cases with **loops**
- [x] **Problem 3**
	- detection of the connected components of an undirected graph
	- adjmat - https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/277045/easiest-way-to-determine-all-disconnected-sets-from-a-graph
	- revise | more testcases
- [ ] **Problem 4**
	- min diff | no clue
	- wrong testcase | suboptimal
- [x] **Problem 5**
	- generate combos
	- same power set impl
- [x] **Problem 6**
	- dfs
- [ ] **Problem 7**
	- extension of topological sorting
- [x] **Problem 8**
	- always sorted?
	- no duplicates in one set?
- [x] **Problem 9**
	- time overlap
	- always sorted?
	- first sample doubt(<= case)
- [ ] **Problem 10**
	- not now
### TODO:

- [ ] implement every problem using dynamic mem allocation
- [ ] check corner cases for all
- [ ] check for directed graphs
