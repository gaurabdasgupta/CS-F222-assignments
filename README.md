# CS-F222 @ BITS-Pilani Assignments

## Assignment 1

- [x] **Problem 1**
	- improve complexity(currently O(n^3))
- [x] **Problem 2**
	- topological sorting
	- ~~easier impl? adj matrix~~
	- ~~detect cycle~~
	- ~~failed in b->a<->c | loop in subgraph~~
	- check for more test cases with **loops**
- [x] **Problem 3**
	- detection of the connected components of an undirected graph
	- adjmat - https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/277045/easiest-way-to-determine-all-disconnected-sets-from-a-graph
	- revise | more testcases
- [x] **Problem 4**
	- min diff | prefix sum -- iterate
	- ~~wrong testcase | suboptimal~~
	- extensive test case testing reqd
	- useful testcase : 5 9

- [x] **Problem 5**
	- generate combos
	- same power set impl
- [x] **Problem 6**
	- dfs
- [x] **Problem 7**
	- all possible topological sortings
	- revise
- [x] **Problem 8**
	- always sorted?
	- no duplicates in one set?
- [x] **Problem 9**
	- time overlap
	- ~~always sorted?~~
	- ~~first sample doubt(<= case)~~
- [ ] **Problem 10**
	- not now
### TODO:
